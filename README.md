**MakanMatch is a food-sharing platform deployed by theoretically by the People's Association in Singapore to help reduce food wastage and to foster a sense of community among residents.**

MakanMatch is an ambitious project envisioned and developed by the MakanMatch Team for the Full Stack Development Project module in Year 2 Semester 1 of the Diploma in Information Technology course at Nanyang Polytechnic.

The system (hopefully 😓) should be live at https://makanmatch.com

Hosts can invite fellow guests in their neighbourhood for a meal at their place through this platform, resulting in numerous overall benefits:
- Reducing food wastage
- Fostering a sense of community
- Guests get to have homemade food
- Guests can have food at cheaper prices with fellow neighbours rather than eating out

The increasing food wastage in Singapore and worldwide has raised several environmental concerns; we want to combat the pressing issue effectively through this communal, comprehensive and easy-to-use solution.

Developed with ❤️ by the MakanMatch team, consisting of:
- Prakhar Trivedi ([@Prakhar896](https://github.com/Prakhar896)) - Reservations Management and Overall Lead
- Joshua Long Yu Xuan ([@Sadliquid](https://github.com/Sadliquid)) - Head of Listings Experience
- Joon Jun Han ([@JunHammy](https://github.com/JunHammy)) - Head of Identity Experience
- Lincoln Lim Ken Yang ([@lincoln0623](https://github.com/lincoln0623)) - Head of Platform Quality
- Nicholas Chew Xun Cheng ([@nicholascheww](https://github.com/nicholascheww)) - Head of Platform Communications

View food listings by hosts in spectacular and beautiful detail. To protect host privacy, the Google Maps Geocoding API is used to approximate the host's location based on their real provided address. After making a reservation, the exact address is revealed to guests.

Through our comprehensive reviews feature, guests can submit reviews for hosts after having had a meal with them. They can provide both a food rating and hygiene rating, helping other guests on the platform be more informed about the host's service standards.

In the six hour window prior to a listing's time, guests are able to make their payment via the host's PayNoq QR code. Cancellations now are chargeable at rates twice that of the initial reservation cost, but this can be avoided if guests cancel prior to the six hour window.

Hosts are also able to view all of their upcoming listings in a neat calendar UI in the Schedule pane. This helps hosts quickly see when all of their listings are and keep on top of them all.

Finally, the almighty admin portal! Admins/staff on MakanMatch are able to carry our various comprehensive actions to moderate the site's content and usage. Admins are able to issue warnings to hosts who have poor hygeiene grades, ban users, help users unlock their account and also delete accounts.

Admins can also view a dashboard of essential analytics that are intelligently tracked by the system as it is used.

# Integrations

MakanMatch tactfully inter-operates with various third-party and internal services to deliver a seamless user experience. The project boasts:
- Google Maps & Geocoding APIs with Google Cloud
  - Rendering interactive Google Map embeds to navigate listings in different locations
  - Address validation and coordinate geocoding
  - Approximate address computation and approximate coordinate geo-coding
- Firebase Cloud Storage for efficient image uploads and backups
- AWS Relational Database Service for MySQL
  - Provides a robust and cloud-backed database implementation for MakanMatch
- OpenAI GPT 4.0 API, fine-tuned with runtime prompts

The integrations come together across the system's backend and frontend to deliver a fast, amazing and high-quality user experience.

# Frontend Technologies

MakanMatch's frontend uses an intelligent page-load and API communication workflow to enhance efficiency, user feedback and the instantaneousness of data flow.

Page loads go through a custom design cycle:
- Authentication state first initialises and tries to understand if there's any user logged in, and decrypts their information
- A custom networking interface intercepts requests and responses sent by on-page functionality to ensure data consistency and state updates
- View-is-a-function-of-state principle is followed consistently, resulting in a seamless, coherent and smooth user flow throughout all tasks
